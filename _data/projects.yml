  - title: "Dissolution kinetics of granitic Fe-bearing minerals at varying oxygen levels"
    description: "Recent studies have recognized the crucial role of Fe-bearing mineral alteration in silicate weathering, which serves as the long-term regulator for atmospheric CO2 level. Despite the fact that dissolution of those minerals could be very sensitive to oxygen availability, which is known to vary both temporally and spatially, little work has been done to reveal the dependence of Fe-based mineral dissolution on dissolved oxygen. This project aims at filling this knowledge gap by carrying out a series of experiments and implementing with modeling techniques."
